        <h2>The garage is a magical place.</h2>

        <p>
          If you believe the quintessential Silicon Valley story, it‚Äôs where all great startups, well, start up. We‚Äôve all heard about how Apple, Google and Amazon each began in a lowly garage. Today, the humble property where Hewlett Packard was born in the late 1930s - the original ‚Äògarage story‚Äô - bears a plaque proclaiming it the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-apple-hp-microsoft-amazon-started-in-garages-photos-2019-12" target="_blank">‚ÄúBirthplace of Silicon Valley.‚Äù</a> Companies like Dell, Disney,  and Virgin each had their beginnings in a garage.

        </p>

        <p>
          The garage, in particular, is a hatchery for ideas, but what makes the garage so special? It‚Äôs a sub-optimal room that gets hot in the summer, cold in the winter, wet during storms and dusty all the time. It‚Äôs not a great place to work. Roaches can hide in the dark places, crickets in the warm places and black widows in the nooks and crannies.

        </p>

        <p>
          It can be horrible--and therein lies its beauty. A garage starts out as a blank slate, an empty box. A place of untainted potential. There are no rules or requirements in a garage. No demands or outside expectations. No reports to fill out. If you're lucky, you have some basic tools and an uncluttered worktable. But in the blankness, anything can be built--whether an invention or an inventive company.

        </p>

        <p>
          At first you have only yourself to answer to. There‚Äôs no army of people to hide behind if you are not putting in the effort. But good ideas need to be tended to. If ignored, the muse goes away.
        </p>

        <p>
          Imagine scenario A:
          4 people, 1 clean workshop, $50,000, an idea.
        </p>

        <p>
          And imagine a second scenario, scenario B:
          4 people, a cluttered, hot/cold, dry/wet garage, $500, an idea.

        </p>

        <p>
          In scenario A, you will likely spend a few weeks putting up drywall, building work benches, buying tools, and comfy chairs, maybe a couch and a beer fridge. Then the work begins. Wait! What were we doing?

        </p>

        <p>
          In scenario B, you have an idea, boxes of junk, and enough money to buy some basic tools and materials. You are focused. You have no choice but to be effective with the resources at your disposal because you want out of that dusty corner - or you would, except you‚Äôre already having so much fun with your team.

        </p>

        <p>
          The garage, with all its constraints, keeps you focused. When you are in your garage working, suffering in the heat, dealing with the cold, dodging spiders, because the garage is what you can afford, you have no choice but to be highly intentional and effective.

        </p>

        <p>
          As it turns out, constraints are not always a bad thing. Your environment should be constrained in a way that gives your creativity free reign. If it truly is a garage, one of the walls can move. The space opens up to the outside world and all that it might bring. People who share an idea or purpose can gather. In reality, the important part isn‚Äôt the dirty garage and the spiders; it‚Äôs the people and the mindset. It‚Äôs the idea, the hard task and the team. The people are what make it possible.

        </p>

        <p>
          A work process that is crafted to place constraints but still allows for success is a great way to foster creativity.  Here is a simple formula:

        </p>

        <p>
          Hire people who have a self-editing mind-set. Left with too much stimulation, the mind wanders and can get lost in the possibilities. A self-editor works through these things quickly and concentrates on being actionable and effective. If you find self-editing people--and they are skilled, keep them.

        </p>

        <p>
          Set a high bar for the quality of a project. Set realistic goals and be clear about what you hope to achieve. Be decisive. Figure out the best course of action and execute. Place a time constraint on the project. We have all heard the adage: ‚ÄúGood, fast or cheap. Pick two.‚Äù Try this: Mash the good and the fast together, really hard. Set a reasonable budget. If the ‚Äòfast‚Äô is set fast enough, a team will be hard-pressed to overspend, simply because there won‚Äôt be time. People will push hard. Pushing hard is ok; being insane about it is not. Find a balance. Bring in food, healthy snacks, and encourage some play time.

        </p>

        <p>
          At 80% into the project, call for a review. Edit expectations for a reasonable success. Give constructive criticism on the quality of the work, not the people, and praise the people as a team for successes.

        </p>

        <p>
          At completion, they may hit the mark perfectly. And even if they undershoot the high bar, they will have enjoyed a successful experience. Celebrate the lessons learned.
        </p>

        <p>
          Large companies continue pouring money into amenities-laden innovation labs - <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20180338" target="_blank">often with diminishing returns</a>. But the right idea doesn't necessarily need the perfect environment. It forms when the right team, the right mind set, and the right way of doing things come together. This ‚ÄúInnovation Garage‚Äù really is just a recurring romantic theme. Entrepreneurs start out in garages because they believe in something so much that the place doesn‚Äôt matter. Cultivate that conviction at your company, and your team won‚Äôt need to set up in a garage to make the next breakthrough.
