                  <h2>The Productivity Paradox: Prototyping the Future of Work</h2>
          
                  <p>
                    Hatcher’s debut event focused on prototyping new answers to a problem that might sound familiar to your company: it’s harder than ever to come up with real innovations, the kinds of ideas that will push your industry in new directions. Your company spends unprecedented amounts on research and development, and yet <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/IdeaPF.pdf" target="_blank">growth rates in productivity remain essentially flat</a>. You optimize and streamline, expedite every process, but real inspiration is nowhere to be found.
                  </p>
          
                  <p>
                    We have a radical proposition to make: what’s missing isn’t more work, or more time staring at your screen. In fact, it’s the opposite. It’s… fun.
                  </p>
          
                  <p>
                    Fun? Yeah, that’s what we said. So we invited a few of our friends & colleagues to join an interactive forum about how to bring the power of play back into the workplace. The Academy & Emmy Award winning inventor, Michael Keesling, who is Principal of Technology & Invention at Hatcher, offered a keynote exploring non-precious prototyping as a second childhood to unlock creativity and generate unexpected new ideas. Next, our panel took center stage: hosted by storyteller & filmmaker Andy Romanoff, our panelists included Andrea Mangini, Director of Product Design for Studio Innovation at Netflix; Eric Gradman, Founder of Two Bit Circus; Maureen Reilly, Concept Designer at LEGO Education; and educator, maker & artist Gil Grimmett, who also showed up with an awesomely unconventional icebreaker. If you missed it, <a href="https://vimeo.com/528808390" target="_blank">here’s a link to the highlight reel</a> from our first forum - or you can read on to see what we learned.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Being obsessed with the rigid parameters of productivity comes at the expense of cultivating the expansiveness of creativity. But creativity is, ultimately, what will allow your team to make the kinds of industry-changing leaps you want your company to be known for. By hiring people with broad knowledge bases who you encourage to collaborate freely with more specialized skillsets, you create an environment that encourages intuitive leaps and innovative thinking. And when you do that, you stop refining what exists, and start imagining what’s next.
                  </p>
          
                  <p>
                    That may feel like a risky proposition, but that’s exactly the point. Andrea Mangini, Director of Product Design for Studio Innovation at Netflix, notes that
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    “Large businesses are set up to optimize and control risk, and creativity is risky: you by definition do not know how it’s going to come out.”
          
                  </blockquote>
          
                  <p>
                    That’s why it’s important to say that we’re not talking about surface-level changes here — buying your existing engineering staff 3D printers, painting their workrooms brighter colors, and calling it a day. Instead, committing to playfulness “takes work,” Mangini continues, “and you have to do it as intentionally as controlling for information security or legal risk or compliance issues.”
          
                  </p>
          
                  <p>
                    That is, in part, why we founded Hatcher: to help companies reinvent themselves by committing to creativity in every element of their business. Our goal is a deep re-imagination of how we work and why, to help build a company culture that will reshape everything, from your day-to-day workflow to the ultimate impact your work has on the world around you.
          
                  </p>
          
          
          
                  <h2>The idea of playfulness may sound, well, frivolous, but it actually has deep roots in our lives and minds. Free play is one of the earliest tools that humans use to understand and interact with the world:</h2>
                   <p>
                    <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3574776/" target="_blank">it’s how children learn spatial reasoning and motor skills</a>. Our earliest experiments are not pieces of careful research, but unstructured interactions, which allow us to continually encounter the unexpected.
                    </p>
          
                  <p>So it makes sense that play keeps our brains young and agile even as adults. Within the context of the workplace, many studies have</p>
          
                  <blockquote>
                    <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00117/full" target="_blank">“established the positive effect of novelty, learning, and skill acquisition on cognitive functioning and regional gray matter volume.”</a>
                  </blockquote>
                    in contrast,
                  </p>
                  <blockquote><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00117/full" target="_blank">“routinization has found to be negatively associated with cognitive flexibility and linked with more pronounced cognitive decline.”</a></blockquote>
                  <p>
                    For workers who regularly engage in monotonous tasks, the stakes couldn’t be higher: their ability to think is quite literally on the line.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Then why isn’t trying new things a major part of the workplace? Well, we’ve been taught to view <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/03/busyness-status-symbol/518178/" target="_blank">“busyness” as a status symbol</a>, and so the idea of time spent without the expectation of results can feel like sacrilege. Unfortunately, though, that busyness ends up hobbling us in the ways that matter most: a brain bogged down by protocols might be able to accomplish a routine task, but is <a href="https://freakonomics.com/podcast/no-new-ideas/" target="_blank">highly unlikely to be able to come up with a strategy to eliminate that task entirely</a>. Corporate R&D armies focus on improving efficiency and optimizing processes, without ever asking if they’re getting efficient at the wrong things.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Becoming immersed in a state of flow is the adult version of play — plus, it makes us more productive.
          
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When work is most effective, it is indistinguishable from play. You can already see this happening in certain industries: programmers, athletes and musicians, among others, experience a common <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20190204-how-to-find-your-flow-state-to-be-peak-creative" target="_blank">state of flow</a> that marries their technical skill to their creative brain and allows them to transcend traditional ways of thinking and making. Maureen Reilly, who serves as a Concept Designer at LEGO Education, says “My best advice for cultivating a culture of innovation is to give designers time, space, and to trust them.” She adds that the best managers she ever had would respect her when she was in a flow state, and re-schedule check-ins around times when Maureen was deeply engaged with her work so she could continue to create undisturbed.
                  </p>
          
          
                  <p>
                    So how do you encourage employees to find their flow? Drawing from experience inventing for everyone from elite soldiers to cinematographers and kids at museums, one of our most effective techniques is to prioritize non-precious prototyping: an approach that prioritizes creativity over calculation, and making over planning.
                  </p>
          
                  <p>
                    A traditional prototype is made to careful spec, with robust processes and materials. This method is centered on engineering, and requires measurements, calculations, designs, and sometimes manufacturing equipment to achieve. It gives the prototype high fidelity to the final product — but it does so at a high cost, both of materials, but perhaps more importantly, of mental effort and employee time.
          
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A precious prototype is often conceived by a single person, and then executed by a team. When you examine it, this workflow reveals itself to be fundamentally backward: you get one brain on a problem, and then sink dozens of people’s weeks and months into executing it before you even have any sense of whether it will work or not.
          
                  </p>
                  <figure class="text-component__block text-component__block--right">
                    <img src="/assets/img/Update2-Graphic4-ProductivityParadox-Sketch.jpg" alt="Productivity Paradox Sketch">
                  </figure>
                  <p>
                    Start with the bare minimum required to communicate the idea, and improve the fidelity as you go.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A non-precious prototype, on the other hand, is much closer to a sketch than a technical diagram. You begin by constructing rather than calculating; you make it with the tools and materials that you have on hand in order to get to a decision point as quickly as possible. Michael Keesling, Principal of Technology & Invention at Hatcher, advises, “Take a step back and think about the easiest questions to answer with the least amount of effort,” and when you get stuck, “Use different parts of your brain to help you solve problems.” This allows employees the flexibility to try on and discard multiple concepts without getting too attached to any of them; they can quickly and easily pivot and re-think before going too far down any particular rabbit hole, saving time and resources for everyone.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They may also come up with better ideas, period. Eric Gradman, founder of Two Bit Circus and Creator of STEAM Carnival, puts it this way: “It’s the act of working that brings an idea into focus. Inspiration happens during work, not before work. When you put your hands on materials, you’ll find that the idea flows more swiftly.”
          
                  </p>
          
                  <p>
                    Because non-precious prototyping doesn’t require employees to do highly specialized work, it encourages collaboration, and is mentally liberating from start to finish. It keeps your team in a fertile, creative headspace rather than instantly trapping them in tedium and rigor of to-spec production. And it saves their time and energy, so rather than sinking weeks into a prototype that was always going to fail, they’re able to figure out what works, get it going, and then use the rest of the day to experiment with something truly interesting and ambitious — the stuff of true innovation, not just incremental improvements.
          
                  </p>
                  <figure class="text-component__block">

                  <p>
                    For the same unit of time and money, anon-precious prototype delivers far more answers than a precious one.
          
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Over the course of her career developing professional technology products at scale, Andrea Mangini has discovered the difference between small, early failures, which she sees as the path to success, and larger, more consequential ones, which non-precious prototyping can help prevent. “Bad failure is when you’ve spent all your money and all your time on something that turns out to be over-engineered and under-thought,” Mangini notes. “What’s essential [to success] is lots of small failures really fast, each of which brings us higher and higher confidence that we’re on the path to the right thing.”
          
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Maybe this sounds intriguing, but you’re not totally bought in yet. So let’s get to the bottom line (pun very much intended): it can save you an incredible amount of money.
          
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As a team, we’ve seen more than one instance where one hour of non-precious prototyping saved some 400 hours of engineers’ work on a poor course. Carry that into a billable rate multiplied throughout every decision, every cycle, every product, and every department within your organization, and things get really staggering. For that kind of savings, even one non-precious prototype can save you enough to buy every engineer on the project a pony and stabling for a decade, and still have money for lunch. So imagine the slush fund you’ll accrue by using this process five or ten times over, on several projects over the course of the year.
          
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Imagine the things you can build, if you didn’t get stuck on the things you can’t.
          
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For this kind of benefit, this is something that should be mandatory, regardless of the enjoyment — but this article has its roots in fun. Because the truth is, most of the ideas that have changed the world weren’t built in cubicle farms — they were dreamed up by inventors who were obsessed with their subjects, and free to work however they pleased. Next time you look to your team to be more creative, think of Thomas Edison, the Wright brothers, Alexander Fleming, and all the other tinkerers who explored their own interests and wound up bringing us innovations like the lightbulb, the airplane, and penicillin.
          
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Playfulness is a virtuous cycle. It makes work fun (actually fun, not I’ve-gamified-getting-my-expense-reports-done fun), which keeps employees motivated and engaged while also encouraging them to do their best, most out-of-the-box work. It saves you money while also attracting new talent — because who wouldn’t want to work at a place that prioritizes adventure while still turning out best in class results?
          
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Imagine your next project. Will project managers sit there in mental handcuffs while engineers exhaust time and resources chasing the wrong answers down the rabbit hole? Can the staff even recognize when they are mired and unbury themselves before it’s too late? And most importantly, will they be allowed to spend time having fun by learning or throwing together some non-precious prototypes for the greater good of the project?
          
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Maybe instead of following their routine, the team will have the freedom to learn a new skill or play a game they’ve never tried before, just for the fun of it. Maybe your project manager will take a half step back from the routine process and encourage the crew to build highly intentional non-precious prototypes that speak volumes to everyone working on the challenges. Maybe your team’s horizons will broaden, your product will improve, and your approach will attract other big thinkers who bring new ideas to your table.
          
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So maybe, just maybe, the future of your company depends on it.
