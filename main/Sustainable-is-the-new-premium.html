                  Whether considering a product, or selecting a service, younger generations increasingly support organizations that are committed to environmental responsibility. Brands that commit to sustainability <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Global20Sustainability20Report_October202015.pdf?utm_source=luxe.digital" target="_blank">outperform those that don't</a>. Full stop. So why are companies still wary?</p>
        
                <p>More and more evidence is piling up that environmental stewardship is top of mind for global consumers, especially among purpose-driven young people. Two thirds of North American consumers - of all ages - say <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/two-thirds-of-north-americans-prefer-eco-friendly-brands-study-finds-51578661728" target="blank">they prefer environmentally responsible brands</a>.</p>

                <blockquote>“It aligns with my values,” says Rea. “Humans are causing immense harm to the planet, so I try to make choices that create as much harm reduction as possible.”</blockquote>
        
                <p>
                  Consumers like Rea are not alone.

                  An <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/EXK4XKX8" target="_blank">IBM study found that more than seven in ten surveyed consumers would voluntarily pay an average premium of 35% more for eco-friendly products</a>.
                Long seen as a fringe movement, zero-waste shopping is just one of the sustainable behaviors that <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/EXK4XKX8" target="_blank">60% of today’s buyers say they’re willing to adopt</a>. The New York University Center for Sustainable Business (CSB) found that sustainable, consumer packaged goods accounted for <a href="https://fortune.com/2019/11/05/sustainability-marketing-consumer-spending/" target="_blank">50% of the sales growth in the category - even though they represent less than 17% of the market</a>.

                <p>
                  Though consumer brands are naturally leading the conversation, this movement is equally impactful at the B2B level. Consider this: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/four-trends-impacting-future-sustainable-b2b-brands-james-bryce-smith?trk=public_profile_article_view" target="_blank">in only 4 years, 70% of the workforce will be millennials</a>.

As these workers climb the corporate ladder, your organization’s sustainability agenda - or lack thereof - could have a <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90306556/most-millennials-would-take-a-pay-cut-to-work-at-a-sustainable-company" target="_blank"> huge impact on whether employees stay</a> or take their talents elsewhere. Today’s junior hires will become tomorrow’s decision makers. Millennials and Gen Z will continue setting evergreen standards for where they’re willing to do business, take a job, or make a purchase.

                  So if you believe that the time is ripe for change: what can you do about it? Whether you’re just starting out or trying to level up your commitment to the planet, here are three proven strategies to make environmental action the heartbeat of your company - and can sustainably supercharge your business in the process.

                <p><blockquote>1 - Prioritize customer experiences over products</blockquote></p>
        
                <p>
                  Today, the take-make-waste model reigns supreme: a customer buys an item, throws out the packaging, uses the product for a short period of time, and then throws away whatever is left. In a world with finite resources, that was never going to work for long.
                </p>

                  Apple rewards customers for trading in their phones, which keeps new product sales high - while enabling them to offer an industry-first <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/07/apple-commits-to-be-100-percent-carbon-neutral-for-its-supply-chain-and-products-by-2030/" target="_blank">100 percent recycled rare earth elements in the latest iPhone Taptic Engine</a>. Consumer goods giant <a href="https://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/96312-colgate-palmolive-launches-softsoap-foaming-hand-soap-tablets" target="_blank">Colgate-Palmolive recently launched the first refillable soap canisters</a> by a large-scale brand, Softsoap, in the US. Instead of buying conventional hand soap, throwing the container out every month or so, and then grabbing whatever option happens to be available at the grocery, customers will seek out the Softsoap tablets in order to refill their keepsake bottle. They take up less room in a grocery bag, delivering another straightforward improvement to the Colgate-Palmolive customer experience.

                  Enduring, curated experiences will always create deeper relationships than single-use products, so take advantage of sustainability as a chance to be visionary in the services you provide.
        
                </p>
                <p><blockquote>2 - Create authentic opportunities</blockquote></p>
                <p>
                  The beautiful thing about sustainability is that it applies to every business on this planet of ours. But that doesn’t mean environmental stewardship is a one-size-fits-all strategy - quite the opposite. The first step here is to identify the aspects of sustainability that resonate most with your brand identity. So instead of picking a few one-off projects that seem attainable, start questioning every aspect of your analytics, operations, and supply chain from a sustainability perspective. Is there a chance to reduce your shipping emissions - and costs - by picking a supplier closer to your manufacturing hub? Is there a nontoxic cleaning company that can deliver a safer service at a better price? What kind of energy is powering your offices and data centers?  Do you have a plan for what happens to your products after your customers are done with them?
        
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once you’ve identified a set of goals that feel true to your company, make a measurable promise to your customers, your partners, and your employees. This must not be a marketing ploy, and if you make it one, you’re missing a massive growth opportunity. Take the opportunity to build a deeper relationship with your community by working together to deliver on those promises. Show that you are taking sustainability seriously by holding yourself accountable for your own progress - because if you don’t, your customers will do it for you.
        
                </p>
                <p>
                  If we leverage the circular economy thoughtfully, we can create recurring customer experiences that are both more desirable and more sustainable than those experiences associated with conventional products. And in the process, you can reinforce loyalty to your company.

                  Way back in 2014, Tesla made the decision to <a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you" target="_blank">effectively open source its electric vehicle patents</a>, hoping to ignite a new era of sustainable transport. Their leadership has continued to drive the industry forward. Invite your company’s community to be actively engaged in your progress, through their support, decisions, purchases, behavior changes, advocacy, and input. We all want to be part of the solution.
        
                </p>
                <p>
                  Test your ideas to integrate sustainability into your operations, your supply chain, your customer experience, and other areas throughout your organization. Measure your success against metrics that matter to your people and your planet. If one initiative doesn’t work, leverage the ingenuity of your employees to come up with something better. If sustainability may seem like a far-off goal, remember that the best way to get to any objective is to start.
        
                </p>

                  Sustainability is a community act. When you make targeted investments in environmental responsibility, it’s absolutely essential to make them tangible to your customers. Many large companies are making significant strides in sustainability behind the scenes, but their commitments are essentially invisible to the customers who started this conversation in the first place. Think about how you can showcase the impact your new strategy will have on the environment, in a way that feels salient to your customers or partners.
